1. Configurable board size for gameplay using JSON external file.
2. Counter for mines and restart game button.
3. Games Assets used from Kenney.nl


Work In Progress
1. Autoplay AI
2. DFS automative search for all neighbours of a Block in AI (Initially bit complex to develop and need for choosing between accuracy and performance)
3. MVP/MVC architecture

AI is tricky to build but not entirely impossible need some time tinkering around the best algorithm to choose from.
